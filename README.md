# Public-Pterodactyl-Discord-Bot
 Public Pterodactyl Bot built for servers.

# Why Archive?

My idea was to use this to start up a host. I realized how unrealistic that is, especially when I was going to manage it via Discord. I also stopped coding this bot when I starting my 9th year in high school, and never look back. Code is too outdated for me to use.
